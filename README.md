Sandor Laboratories IoT Core
2020 Ed Sandor

This project defines a library that may be used to quickly start Internet of Things projects by wrapping common libraries and writing common utilities.

To start, sliot_core_config.h should be modified to enable or disable features as needed as well as sub-config files for per feature settings.  Config files that may use private passwords or keys are saved as .example and should be renamed after filling in keys.
